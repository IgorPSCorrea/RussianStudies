# Russian Language Study Scripts

This repository contains HTML files with tables of words and phrases to aid in the study of the Russian language. Each file includes a table with three columns: the word or phrase in Russian, phonetics, and English translation. Each word/phrase has a "speak" button that utilizes the browser's speech synthesis API.
